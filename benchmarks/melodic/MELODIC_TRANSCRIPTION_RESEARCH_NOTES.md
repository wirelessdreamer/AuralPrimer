# Melodic Transcription Research Notes

## Goal

Find the best melodic transcription approach for bass, guitar, and keys/synth, using human-authored MIDI references from Psalms 1-7 as ground truth.

This document is the living research tracker for melodic transcription algorithm evaluation. It mirrors `benchmarks/drums/HYBRID_RESEARCH_AND_TRACKER.md`.

## Benchmark Rule

Every run must follow [PROCESS.md](PROCESS.md). Static output review is mandatory after each run. No webserver is required.

The minimum review set is:

- `overall_f1_heatmap.svg`
- `pitch_accuracy_heatmap.svg`
- `octave_error_heatmap.svg`
- `algorithm_summary.svg`
- `instrument_summary.svg`
- `timing_mae.svg`

## Algorithms Under Test

| Algorithm | Type | Dependencies | Key Idea |
|---|---|---|---|
| `melodic_basic_pitch` | ZCR + dyad | None | Current baseline, zero-crossing rate |
| `melodic_pyin` | ZCR | None | Slightly different ZCR params |
| `melodic_yin` | Autocorrelation | numpy | YIN CMNDF, parabolic interpolation |
| `melodic_onset_yin` | YIN + onset | numpy | YIN + energy-based onset segmentation |
| `melodic_hpss_yin` | HPSS + YIN | librosa | Harmonic preprocessing, then YIN |
| `melodic_fft_hps` | FFT + HPS | None | Harmonic Product Spectrum |
| `melodic_librosa_pyin` | Prob YIN + HMM | librosa | librosa.pyin() with octave-error resistance |

> **Note:** `melodic_crepe` (CREPE neural pitch) is not available on Python 3.13 due to `pkg_resources` removal. Can be re-added when `crepe` package is updated.

## Run 1: Baseline (2026-03-12)

**Run dir:** `benchmarks/melodic/runs/20260312_123751_baseline/`

### Aggregate Results (Mean across 19 songs)

| Algorithm | Mean F1 | Pitch Acc | Octave Err | Best On |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `melodic_basic_pitch` (ZCR) | ~0.09 | ~10% | ~10% | — |
| `melodic_pyin` (ZCR) | ~0.08 | ~8% | ~7% | — |
| **`melodic_onset_yin`** | **~0.22** | ~17% | ~22% | F1, recall |
| **`melodic_fft_hps`** | **~0.23** | **~22%** | ~16% | Pitch accuracy |
| `melodic_hpss_yin` | ~0.22 | ~19% | ~21% | Precision |
| `melodic_yin` | ~0.19 | ~18% | ~24% | — |
| `melodic_librosa_pyin` | ~0.12 | ~22% | ~30% | Octave errors on some songs |

## Run 2: Experiment (2026-03-12)

**Run dir:** `benchmarks/melodic/runs/20260312_192359_experiment-2/`

5 new algorithm variants tested alongside the 7 baselines:

| Variant | Key Change | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `melodic_yin_t020` | YIN threshold 0.20 (stricter voicing) | Marginal improvement over 0.15 default |
| `melodic_yin_bass80` | 80ms frames for bass | **F1=0.598 on Ps2 Bass, 91.5% pitch acc on Ps4 Bass** |
| **`melodic_combined`** | Onset detection + HPS pitch + YIN fallback | 🏆 **New overall leader — wins 16+/19 songs** |
| `melodic_hpss_onset` | HPSS + onset-aware YIN | Strong 2nd — wins on some guitar songs |
| `melodic_pyin_long` | librosa pYIN w/ 4096 frame_length | Improves bass but high octave errors |

### Key Findings

1. **`melodic_combined` is the new overall F1 leader** — onset detection from onset_yin + HPS pitch estimation + YIN fallback gives best of both worlds
2. **`melodic_yin_bass80` achieves 91.5% pitch accuracy** on Ps4 Bass — 80ms frames are critical for bass fundamental detection
3. **Combined approach wins 16+/19 songs** with best F1 range 0.17–0.54 across all instruments
4. **Octave errors drop to ~10–15%** for combined (vs 22–30% for single-method approaches)
5. **`melodic_hpss_onset` is the best single-approach** — HPSS + onset detection consistently 2nd place
6. **Guitar remains the hardest instrument** — best F1 ~0.27 on guitar vs ~0.54 on bass

### Per-Instrument Best F1 (peak per-song values)

| Instrument | Best Algorithm | Best F1 | Song |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Bass | `melodic_yin_bass80` | 0.598 | Psalm 2 |
| Bass | `melodic_combined` | 0.540 | Psalm 2 |
| Bass | `melodic_combined` | 0.508 | Psalm 1 |
| Guitar | `melodic_hpss_onset` | 0.362 | Psalm 1 |
| Guitar | `melodic_combined` | 0.334 | Psalm 1 |
| Keys | `melodic_hpss_onset` | 0.372 | Psalm 1 |
| Keys | `melodic_basic_pitch` | 0.339 | Psalm 5 |
